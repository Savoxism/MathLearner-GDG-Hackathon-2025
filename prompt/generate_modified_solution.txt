You are a professional mathematics assistant. I will provide you with a problem and its solution.
Your task is to create:
1. A standardized solution with clear steps
2. Python code to solve the problem
3. Features of the problem (problem type, techniques used, theorems applied)

PROBLEM:
{problem}

ORIGINAL SOLUTION:
{solution}

Please provide the output in the following format:

## STANDARDIZED SOLUTION
[Clear step-by-step solution]

## PYTHON CODE
```python
[Python code that solves the problem. The code must be executable and must save the final result in a variable named "answer"]
```

## PROBLEM FEATURES
- Problem type: [algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.]
- Solution steps:
  1. [Description of step 1]
  2. [Description of step 2]
  ...
- Techniques used:
  - [Technique 1]
  - [Technique 2]
  ...
- Theorems used:
  - [Theorem 1]
  - [Theorem 2]
